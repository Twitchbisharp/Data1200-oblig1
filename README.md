# Data1200 oblig1
 Hey!
 This is an obligatory assignment for the course "Data1200 Webutvikling og Inkluderende Design".

 Message for the contributors:
 Remember that each and everyone of you should hand in a PDF of this project.
 This is done in Canvas "Oppgaver>Oblig 1: Simple page".
 The assignment is due Friday 1. oct 20:00.
 In the PDF-file the following must be included:

    * Name of everyone involved in the project

    * Student number of everyone involved in the project

    * A link to the GitHub-page(s)
    
In effect, this would result in everyone in the same group submitting the same PDF, but everyone is still responsible for submitting a PDF.


Task:

* Create an inclusive website of a cafe/restaurant

* It should contain at least seven dishes, between three courses (lunch, dinner, snack, etc.)

* Structure the contents of the website in the best possible way for both humans and search engines

* Several dishes should contain different allergens - and these must be simple and easily identifyable in the menu

* Main ingredients or description for each dish

* Easy to find opening hours, location and contact information
